    "### Building a simple model\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The main idea with Mesa is to create two classes, one for the model and the other for the agents. The agent handles the behavior of the individual being simulated such as how it can infect neighbors in a grid or network. The model holds all the general parameters, a grid object for moving agents on and it also creates and tracks it's agents. It's really much more instructive to go through an example than describe. This code was made mostly using the Mesa tutorial on Virus on network example.<br><br>\n",
    "We first make a Model class defining a grid, scheduler for tracking the order of agents being activated in time. Time periods are represented as steps and the agents can all move once in each step. The the agents will decide if it can infect another according to where it is. The DataCollector class keeps track of agent information through the simulation. The grid is a MultiGrid class, which let more than one agent occupy a cell at once."
